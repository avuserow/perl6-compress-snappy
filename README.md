# DESCRIPTION

This module uses NativeCall to provide bindings to the C API for libsnappy, a
compression library with an emphasis on speed over compression.

# FUNCTIONS

## Compress::Snappy::compress(Blob $uncompressed) returns Buf

Main compression function. Returns a Buf of compressed data.

## Compress::Snappy::compress(Str $uncompressed, Str $encoding = 'utf-8') returns Buf

Convenience function to make a Str to an encoded Blob and compress that.
Encoding defaults to utf-8 if not specified.

## Compress::Snappy::decompress(Blob $compressed, Str $encoding)
